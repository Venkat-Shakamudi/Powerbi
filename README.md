Section1-Basic Charts in Power Bi 
To create basic charts in power bi I am taking a File Called Superstore ,its like amazon, DMart where we are having Order summary, Sales summary and People and Returns. In the first step we are importing data from excel and loading data to power bi without using transform data because data is clean.
After loading data there are 
there are different tabs  in rightmost side called data, build , format we have to use these tabs to create charts.
1)column chart
for creating column ,We have to use Stacked Column chart in build tab and I am taking Subcategory into axis and sales into values .We have successfully Created our first chart in powerbi and We can do changes However we want by using different tabs in powerbi interface whether it is changing name and changing background color and font size, font colour.
2)Stacked Column 
Stacked Column Chart is same as column chart but we have to take region into legend, in which sales are divided by regions.
3)pie chart
For creating pi chart we have to use pie chart in build ,For creating pie chart we have to choose column which are having values less than 5 like region having only 4 different values like north ,south ,west, east .while creating a pi chart we can use detail labels where we can Enable detail label for all ,so that our presentation become easy.
4)Donut Chart
It is difficult to create donut chart in tableau where as we can easily create donut chart in powerbi.
5)Funnel Chart
from Build field we have to select funnel chart. If we take subcategory and sales the subcategory with bigger width having higher sales and subcategory with lesser width having lesser sales.
6)Ribbon chart.
By using ribbon chart I can check sales analysis by each year to create that we have date function in axis and sales into values. We have taken time frame in x axis and sum of sales in y axis and region in legend field so that we get sales per region per every year.
7)What is Include and Exclude 
1)If we want compare sales between two categories in stacked column chart or whatever chart First we have to select two categories by using ctrl then we have to right click there we have to choose the option include.
2)If you don't want to include some categories in your you can use exclude by right clicking the selected ones.
